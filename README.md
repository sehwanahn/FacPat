# Abstract
Drug discovery is a complex and interdisciplinary field that requires the identification of potential drug targets for specific diseases. In this study, we present FacPat, a novel approach that identifies the optimal factor-specific pattern explaining the drug-induced gene expression profile. FacPat uses a genetic algorithm based on pattern distance to mine the optimal factor-specific pattern for each gene in the LINCS L1000 dataset. We applied Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg correction to control the false discovery rate and identified significant and interpretable factor-specific patterns consisting of 480 genes, 7 chemical compounds, and 38 human cell lines. Using our approach, we identified genes that show context-specific effects related to chemical compounds and/or human cell lines. Furthermore, we performed functional enrichment analysis to characterize biological features. We demonstrate that FacPat can be used to reveal novel relationships among drugs, diseases, and genes.
